CODING WITH MOSH - JAVASCRIPT BASICS -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables - like boxes, You store things inside the box and give it a name. Variables are the same. Example:

    let age = 30.

Sometimes multiple variables can go toghther. This is an object. Objects are declared with { Object literal }. Example:

    let person = {
        name: "Mosh",
        age: 30,
        gender: "male"
    };

Multiple object literals can go toghther in an array [{ example }]

    const shoppingCart = ["apple" "orange" "banana"]
    shoppingCart[3] = 1;
    console.log(shoppingCart)
